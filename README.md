# Progressive Web App template
A boilerplate template for building static progressive web apps. Includes examples for features such as 'Add to home screen', offline mode, push notifications and more.

## Getting started
### 1. Download and run local server
Install Web server for Chrome here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb
Why? Localhost (or https) is required for enabling pwa.

### 2. (optional) Create an application server key
Not required -- a key is already public in the repo. The Base64 key is used for registering push notifications.
